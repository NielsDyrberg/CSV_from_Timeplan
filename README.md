# CSV_from_Timeplan

By Niels Dyrberg - 11-11/19

Using the script is under your own responsibility

Automated CSV file download from Timeplan

For now it only works if you have Google Chrome installed, so install that if you dont already use it.

To use this script, you will need Python 3.6 or 3.7 installed.

After installing Python, open CMD or Terminal as admin
and run:
  'pip install selenium' To install selenium package.

Now go into login.json and fill-out your credentials for Timeplan
If you are on a Mac you will have to change the PATH variable too the full path, something like "/Users/'your usesrname'/Documents/Timeplan/drivers"

If you are on a Windows you should now be able to run the script by double pressing on run.bat. 
For mac press run.command.
The browser will close automaticaly and you should now have a file called 'vagter.csv' this is the one you want to upload too your Google Calendar.

You can now upload the vagter.csv too your Google Calendar, which you can sync whit your phone.

You can contact me on 'ncpd@live.dk' if you have any problems setting it up.
