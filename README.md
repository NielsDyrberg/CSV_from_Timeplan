By Niels Dyrberg

Using the script is under your own responsibility

Automated CSV file download from Timeplan

To use this script, you will need Python 3.6 installed.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/
a newer version might work, but i dont guarantee anything!

After installing Python, open CMD or Terminal as admin
and run:
  'pip install selenium' To install selenium package.

After this you will have too download a Browser Driver
Chrome:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
Safari: (Not tested)
  https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/

Place the driver a place where you know the full path, and the open total.py, to add the path, and fill out your username and password.

If you are on a Windows you should now be able to run the script by double pressing on run.bat. For mac press run.sh (Mayby - Not tested)
The browser will close automaticaly and you should now have a file called 'final.csv' this is the one you want to upload too your Google Calendar.
